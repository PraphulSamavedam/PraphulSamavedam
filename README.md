### Software Development Engineer | Amazon AGI Team
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Building the future of Artificial General Intelligence at **Amazon AGI**, where I architect and scale core AI infrastructure powering next-generation AI systems that process and learn at unprecedented Amazon scale.

With over **5+ years** of specialized experience in AI/ML engineering across **Amazon, Nvidia, UBS, BNY Mellon, and innovative AI startups**, I combine deep technical expertise in distributed AI systems, LLM infrastructure, multi-agent systems, and production ML systems with a track record of delivering high-impact solutions at scale.

### What I'm Building Now
At Amazon's AGI division, I engineer **core infrastructure** that powers next-generation AI systems at scale. My work focuses on building distributed systems that enable AI to learn, reason, and operate across diverse domains—pushing the boundaries of what's possible in artificial intelligence.

**Interested in AGI, distributed AI systems, or building ML at scale?** Let's connect.

### Background & Expertise

**Education**
- **MS in Artificial Intelligence** | Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University | **GPA: 4.0/4.0**
- **B.E. (Hons) in Electrical & Electronics Engineering** | BITS-Pilani | India's #1 Private University

My interdisciplinary background—from hardware architecture and electrical engineering to advanced AI—enables me to design optimized ML infrastructure and multi-agent systems that consider the full stack, from distributed system design and algorithm optimization to hardware acceleration on GPUs, TPUs, and custom AI accelerators.
